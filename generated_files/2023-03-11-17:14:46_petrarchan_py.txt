to bear down further into memory
even warning comes through to suggestion
days heart compost into your recycling
when I suggested you would end ingrown
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
until a seamless sky passed through greeting
more day extending heat to your compost.
If it is not warm however seamlessly

that not to fill a cloudless greeting one
not to fill a godless sky greeting one
phasing recycled air into compost
until a seamless sky passed through heating
when I suggested you would die alone
when I suggested you would be alone
until a dreamless sky passed through phasing
and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
If it is a warm day and after noon
until not an ingrown sky through greeting
even warning comes through my suggestion
days recycling heart into your compost 
If it is not warm and not seamlessly
more days extending hear to your compost
recycled suits into your good compost
when I suggested you would end alone
archived
not filling a cloudless greeting sky one
compost days heat into your recycling
like works turning from within the heap
even warming comes from out digestion
even warning gives my suggestion days
like words turning under from the heap
phasing recycled parts into compost
re-recycled hearts into your compost
more days extending heat to your compost
more day extending heat to your compost
If it is not warm however and not
the heat of bile warms 
seamlessly archived
If it is not warm however and say
more days recycling heart to your compost
If it is not warm however cloudless
until an unseen sky passed through phasing
recycled parts into your good compost
unless 
not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one
If not warm from turning through what was lost
if it is a warm day and after noon
like worms turning around under the heap
and turn under the broken earth with worms
compost heart to your days recycling
even warming the compound
recycled hearts into your food compost
compost days bring heat to your recycling
that you hear under the top soil
not to fill a seamless sky greeting one
until a seamless sky passed through phasing
even warning comes from my suggestions
not until an ingrown sky through greeting
that decades of dental decay canâ€™t fix
until a seamless sky passed through singing
like terms turning to sound under the heap
If it is a warm day and after noonthe heat of vile worms  
more day extending hear to your compost
even under the turning heap with worms
If it is warning
more days recycling heat to your compost
not until a seamless sky through greeting
to bear down further into memory 
like worms churning around under the heap
If not warm from churning through 
early warning comes fro my suggestion
until an ingrown sky passed through greeting
of grounded greetings
compost days sing heat to your recycling
of the composted heart 
If it is a worm day and after noon
to bear down further down the winter soil
