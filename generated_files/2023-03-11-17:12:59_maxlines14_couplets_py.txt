like worms turning around under the heap
archived

If it is a worm day and after noon
to bear down further into memory

recycling heart to your flowing compost
If it is a warm day and after noon

and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
seamlessly archived

when I suggested you would be alone
phase compost heart 

to bear down further down the winter soil
even warning gives my suggestion days

of rounded greetings 
not until an ingrown sky through greeting
