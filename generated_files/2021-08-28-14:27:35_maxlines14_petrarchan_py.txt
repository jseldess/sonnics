from still warm shared distant referencing
with fate and tears from eyes I travel through
running translucent immaterial
and withdraw and wait in the unlit

body of disintegrating feelings
signaling and touching a distinctly
When I have nothing to do with feeling
If I reinforce the material

running translucent immaterial state
If I step from one void to another
all the dust of a voided sensory

recoverable support
that makes it hard to
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
