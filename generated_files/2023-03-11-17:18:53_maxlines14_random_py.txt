more days extending heat to your compost



and shut the light out and mocked the late moon




even warning gives my suggestion days
If it is not warm however and not

under the broken earth turning with worms
more days recycling heat to your compost
If it is not warm however and say
to bear down further into memory

archived
If it is a warm day and after noon




even warmer




not to fill a seamless sky greeting one
when I suggested you would die alone
more day extending heat to your compost
