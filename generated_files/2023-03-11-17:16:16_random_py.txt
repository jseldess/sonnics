when I suggested you would be two-tone
when I suggested you would end ingrown
and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
seamlessly archived
Nay, if you read this line, remember not


more day extending heat to your compost.


until an unseen sky passed through phasing
more days extending heat to your compost
If it is a warm day and after noon
until a seamless sky passed through singing
not to fill a godless sky greeting one
that not to fill a cloudless greeting one
to bear down further into memory
not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one

like worms from under the turning heap

unless 
days extending heart into your compost
like words turning under from the heap
to wear down further into memory


even warning gives my suggestion days

until a seamless sky passed through greeting
even warning comes through my suggestion
when I suggested you would be alone
if it is a warm day and after noon
and turn under the broken earth with worms


more day extending heat to your compost



under the broken earth turning with worms
like worms turning around under the heap

to bear down further in decaying mind
If it is a warm day and after noonarchived
recycling
until a seamless sky passed through phasing
If it is not warm however cloudless



like words turning under the grounded heap

even warmer
even warming
more days extending hear to your compost

If it is not warm however and not




phasing recycled air into compost
phasing recycled hear into compost
like worms churning around under the heap
to bear down further into memory 
phase compost heart 
until an ingrown sky passed through greeting



If not warm from turning the broken earth
the heat of vile worms
of rounded greetings 
until a godless sky passed through phasing
even under the turning heap with worms
If it is not warm however seamlessly

under the turning with worms

for not filling a cloudless greeting one
not until an ingrown sky through greeting
the heat of bile warms 




If it is a worm day and after noon

even warming the compound
when I suggested you would end alone
recycling heart into your sound compost

more days recycling heart to your compost
the heat of vile worms  


of 

phasing recycled hearts into compost
of grounded greetings

to bear sound further into memory

until not an ingrown sky through greeting
like terms turning to sound under the heap
If not warm from churning through 
If it is breaking down 
until not a seamless sky through greeting
the days heart compost to your recycling
recycled parts into your good compost




re-recycled hearts into your compost
even warning comes through to suggestion




part phrasing 
not to drill a seamless sky through greeting

days recycling heart into your compost
