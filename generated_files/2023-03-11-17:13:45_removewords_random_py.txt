the light out and mocked the late moon
you read this line, remember not

out the light and mocked the moon
suggested you would end ingrown
is not warm however your heart


turning under from the heap
turning with worms
is a warm day and after noon
sing heat to your recycling

gives my suggestion days
down further into memory
warm from churning through 
suggested you would be alone

heart 




of recycled heat to your compost




down further into memory 
comes from out digestion
extending heat to your compost




to your phasing
the compound



is not dark in the compost 


of vile worms  
fill a seamless sky greeting one
heart into your compost
seamless sky passed through greeting




seamless sky passed through phasing
extending heat to your compost.
comes through to suggestion
fill a cloudless sky greeting one
into your part compost
the turning heap with worms
under the top soil
is not heart in the compost however

turning ground under the heap
composted heart 
will a seamless sky through greeting

turning around under the heap
a seamless sky through greeting




filling a cloudless greeting one


greetings
is not warm however seamlessly


compost into your recycling

is not warm however vile heat

is not warm however phasing




drill a seamless sky through greeting
a cloudless greeting sky one




churning around under the heap

heat to your compost
of dental decay canâ€™t fix

seamless sky passed through singing
bring heat to your recycling
hear into compost
hearts into compost
parts into compost
unseen sky passed through phasing

of decay
into your warm compost
is not warm however and not
into your good compost
is not warm however and say
warm and the volume of vile worms
air into compost



down the tread on my winter boots

unclean sky passed through phasing
is not warned however phrasing
of vile worms
under the broken earth with worms
is not warm however cloudless
an ingrown sky through greeting




comes from my suggestions
suggested you would end alone
