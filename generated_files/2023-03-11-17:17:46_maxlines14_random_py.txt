If it is not warm however and not




and shut the light out and mocked the late moon

and shut out the light and mocked the moon
to bear down further into memory




compost heat days sing to your recycling

like worms turning around under the heap

like works turning from within the heap

If it is not warm however cloudless
that not to fill a cloudless greeting one
archived

even warning gives my suggestion days
more days extending heat to your compost




If it is a warm day and after noon
not to drill a seamless sky through greeting
