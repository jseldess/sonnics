If it is a warm day and after noon


And when the hum is loudest
Everything vibrates there in the median



that you hear under the top soil
Over the wire



even warming under the top soil



For past warming
Find out of the forest
from the market of ideas
DRINK
and shut the light out and mocked the late moon


There in the median
and to find quiet



Units of light quiet
