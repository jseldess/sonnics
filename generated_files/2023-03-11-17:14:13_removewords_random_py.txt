warning comes through to suggestion

warming comes from out digestion




an unseen sky passed through phasing
a seamless sky passed through phasing


shut the light out and mocked the late moon
days of recycled heat to your compost
it is not warm however cloudless
days extending heat to your compost
days bring heat to your recycling

warning gives my suggestion days


it is a warm day and after noon

not to fill a cloudless greeting one




bear down further into memory

it is a worm day and after noon
day extending heat to your compost

heat days sing to your recycling
bear sound further into memory
I suggested you would be alone
bear down further decaying in mind
until an ingrown sky through greeting
a seamless sky passed through greeting
day extending hear to your compost
if you read this line, remember not
day extending heat to your compost.
days recycling heart to your compost
days extending hear to your compost
heat of vile worms  

I suggested you would end ingrown
recycled air into compost
heart into your warm compost
wear down further into memory


to fill a cloudless sky greeting one
a godless sky passed through phasing
heart into your sound compost




recycled heat to your compost

days heart compost to your recycling

to fill a godless sky greeting one
you hear under the top soil
not warm from turning the broken earth



warming under the top soil

parts into your good compost
phrasing 
to will a seamless sky through greeting
warming the compound
filling a cloudless greeting sky one



to drill a seamless sky through greeting
extending heart into your compost
works turning from within the heap
bear down further into memory 
it is not warm however seamlessly

warming

until a seamless sky through greeting



I suggested you would die alone

not filling a cloudless greeting one
the composted heart 
an unclean sky passed through phasing


recycled hear into compost


recycled parts into compost

words turning ground under the heap
it is not warned however phrasing
words turning under from the heap



to fill a seamless sky greeting one

it is not warm however and say
terms turning to sound under the heap
warning comes fro my suggestion
it is warning




it is not warm however and not
it is not warm however vile heat

it is not warm however phasing
recycled art into compost


archived


worms turning around under the heap



not a seamless sky through greeting

days heat into your recycling
more day extending head to compost
heat of vile worms

I suggested you would end alone
days recycling heat to your compost
it is not warm however your heart
not warm from turning through what was lost
recycling heart into your compost
it is not warm however phrasing




recycling heart into your compost 
it is not dark in the compost 
it is a warm day and after noonworms churning around under the heap
the broken earth turning with worms
