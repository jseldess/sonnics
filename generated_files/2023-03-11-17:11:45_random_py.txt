even warning gives my suggestion days
until a seamless sky passed through greeting
not to fill a godless sky greeting one

If not warm from churning through 
until a seamless sky passed through phasing
that you hear under the top soil
and shut the light out and mocked the late moon


when I suggested you would be alone
not until a seamless sky through greeting
compost days heat into your recycling
more day extending heat to your compost
days heart compost into your recycling
when I suggested you would end ingrown




Nay, if you read this line, remember not
phasing recycled art into compost
If it is not warm however cloudless
not to will a seamless sky through greeting
to wear down further into memory




more day extending heat to your compost.
If not warm from turning the broken earth


If it is a warm day and after noon




compost days bring heat to your recycling




If it is not warm however vile heat
to bear down further into memory
If it is not dark in the compost 

more day extending hear to your compost
seamlessly archived
recycling heart into your sound compost
like words turning from under the heap


like worms churning around under the heap



to bear down further into memory 


like worms turning around under the heap

like works turning from within the heap
archived
of rounded greetings 
until not an ingrown sky through greeting
more days extending heat to your compost

recycling heart to your phrasing compost

If it is breaking down 
part phrasing 
even warning comes from my suggestions




the days heart compost to your recycling
If it is not warm however phrasing
until an ingrown sky passed through greeting
If it is not warm however and not

until an unseen sky passed through phasing
even warning comes through my suggestion
If it is not warm however seamlessly
If it is not warm however and say
re-recycled hearts into your compost


If it is not warned however phrasing

compost heart to your phasing recycling
one more day extending head to compost


compost heart to your days recycling
If it is a warm day and after noonto bear sound further into memory

compost heart to your phasing




of 
even warming comes from out digestion


that decades of dental decay canâ€™t fix



when I suggested you would end alone
when I suggested you would die alone
the heat of vile worms  
and shut out the light and mocked the moon
until a godless sky passed through phasing




not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one




not to drill a seamless sky through greeting
If not warm and the volume of vile worms
until a dreamless sky passed through phasing
until an unclean sky passed through phasing
that not to fill a cloudless greeting one




more days recycling heat to your compost

to bear down further decaying in mind


recycled hearts into your food compost
even warning comes through to suggestion

the heat of bile warms 




If it is not warm however phasing
not until an ingrown sky through greeting

not to fill a seamless sky greeting one
even warming the compound
like words turning under the grounded heap




to wear down the tread on my winter boots
not to ill a seamless sky through greeting
