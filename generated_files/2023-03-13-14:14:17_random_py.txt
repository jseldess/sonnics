to bear down further into memory
even warning gives my suggestion days
like words turning under from the heap
of grounded greetings
when I suggested you would end ingrown


to wear down further into memory
and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
recycled hearts into your food compost
recycling heart to your phrasing compost
more days of recycled heat to your compost
days heart compost into your recycling
If it is a warm day and after noon
compost heart to your phasing recycling
phasing recycled hearts into compost
more days recycling heart to your compost
like turns turning the sound inside a heap

not filling a cloudless greeting sky one
more day extending heat to your compost
If it is not warm however phrasing


the heat of vile worms  
of iridescent words left too long out


not to fill a seamless sky greeting one




If not warm from turning the broken earth
of iridescent words left for too long




even warming the compound
not to drill a seamless sky through greeting

when I suggested you would be alone
until a seamless sky passed through greeting
under the broken earth turning with worms

If not warm from turning through what was lost
more days extending hear to your compost
recycled parts into your good compost
If it is not warm however seamlessly
re-recycled hearts into your compost
phasing recycled art into compost
phase compost heart 
to bear down further down the winter soil
recycling
to bear down further decaying in mind
If it is breaking down 



more days extending heat to your compost

the days heart compost to your recycling
like words turning from under the heap
one more day extending head to compost
like worms from under the turning heap



archived
not to fill a godless sky greeting one
until a godless sky passed through phasing
If it is not warm however cloudless
not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one

not until a seamless sky through greeting
like words turning ground under the heap
and turn under the broken earth with worms
even warning comes through to suggestion
when I suggested you would die alone
until a seamless sky passed through heating
If it is not warm however phasing

seamlessly archived
re-recycled parts into your compost

of my mouth



of rounded greetings 
not to will a seamless sky through greeting



to bear down further in decaying mind


If not warm from churning through 
compost heart to your phasing

like words turning under the grounded heap

when I suggested you would be two-tone



the heat of vile worms
like terms turning to sound under the heap
when I suggested you would end alone
If it is not warm however vile heat
like terms churning around under a heap
phasing recycled air into compost


until not a seamless sky through greeting



until a seamless sky passed through phasing

until an unseen sky passed through phasing
even warning comes through my suggestion
even under the turning heap with worms
of the composted heart 
under the turning with worms
like worms turning around under the heap
even warning comes from my suggestions
that you hear under the top soil
days extending heart into your compost



even warming comes from out digestion
phasing recycled heat to your compost
recycling heat into your part compost

phasing recycled parts into compost
until not an ingrown sky through greeting
until an unseen fly passed through phasing

not until an ingrown sky through greeting
unless 
compost heart to your days recycling
If it is not warm however and not
the heat of bile warms 

that not to fill a cloudless greeting one
and shut out the light and mocked the moon
early warning comes fro my suggestion
until an unclean sky passed through phasing



more days recycling heat to your compost



If it is not warm however and say



recycling heart to your flowing compost
not to ill a seamless sky through greeting
If it is not warm however your heart
to bear down further into memory 




If it is warning
to wear down the tread on my winter boots
part phrasing 
even warming
until a dreamless sky passed through phasing




recycling heart into your warm compost
even warmer




like terms churning around inside a heap

even warming under the top soil
compost days heat into your recycling


that you wear under the top soil



days recycling heart into your compost
If it is a worm day and after noon
that decades of decay



for not filling a cloudless greeting one
If not warm and the volume of vile worms




like works turning from within the heap




compost days sing heat to your recycling
like worms churning around under the heap
like terms churning the sound inside a heap
If it is not warm and not seamlessly
compost heat days sing to your recycling

of 


of iridescent and prepackaged words
of iridescent newly packaged words
If it is not warned however phrasing
until a seamless sky passed through singing
If it is not heart in the compost however
If it is a warm day and after noon



phasing recycled hear into compost

recycled suits into your good compost
compost days bring heat to your recycling

that decades of dental decay canâ€™t fix

If it is not dark in the compost 
recycling heart into your sound compost
to bear sound further into memory
of iridescent and repackaged words



until an ingrown sky passed through greeting

more day extending hear to your compost

days recycling heart into your compost
