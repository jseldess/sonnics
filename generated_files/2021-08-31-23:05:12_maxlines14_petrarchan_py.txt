expressions of conditional support
in from to the waiting formal body
When I distinguish the materials
to lift up an orthogonal ground
and withdraw and wait in the unlit
When I distinguish the material

feeling immaterial expressive
in time as an orthogonal concern
When I distinguish around reinforced
from still warm shared distant referencing
