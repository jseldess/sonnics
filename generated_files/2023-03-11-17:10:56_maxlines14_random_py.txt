until an unseen sky passed through phasing
even warning gives my suggestion days




If it is a warm day and after noon
even warming under the top soil



when I suggested you would be alone

If not warm and the volume of vile worms
If it is not dark in the compost 
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
If it is not warm however and not
not to fill a seamless sky greeting one




like words turning from under the heap
more day extending heat to your compost
when I suggested you would end ingrown
to bear down further into memory
