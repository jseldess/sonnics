If it is a warm day and after noon

like words turning under from the heap
to bear down further into memory
like words turning from under the heap


and shut the light out and mocked the late moon

If not warm from turning through what was lost



when I suggested you would end alone
like worms turning around under the heap



archived
until a seamless sky passed through singing
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
If it is not warm however cloudless
If not warm from churning through 
more days extending heat to your compost
to bear down further in decaying mind

even warning gives my suggestion days
part phrasing 
even warmer



like worms from under the turning heap

more day extending heat to your compost.
even warming comes from out digestion




until an unseen sky passed through phasing
when I suggested you would be alone



and shut out the light and mocked the moon




like words turning under the grounded heap
If it is not warm however phrasing

even warning comes through to suggestion
if it is a warm day and after noon
If not warm and the volume of vile worms
like terms turning to sound under the heap
even warming the compound

that not to fill a cloudless greeting one
until a seamless sky passed through greeting


not to fill a godless sky greeting one
not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one


phasing recycled hear into compost

when I suggested you would end ingrown

phasing recycled parts into compost
phase compost heart 
If it is not warm however and say
phasing recycled air into compost

If not warm from turning the broken earth
seamlessly archived
If it is a warm day and after noonIf it is not warm however vile heat
recycling

until not a seamless sky through greeting
to bear down further into memory 
more days recycling heart to your compost

that you wear under the top soil
compost days bring heat to your recycling
of grounded greetings

the heat of vile worms
recycled parts into your good compost
when I suggested you would be two-tone




to bear sound further into memory
If it is not warm however phasing

the days heart compost to your recycling
recycling heat into your part compost


If it is not warm however and not
until an ingrown sky passed through greeting

not to fill a seamless sky greeting one



If it is not warm and not seamlessly
to wear down further into memory



for not filling a cloudless greeting one




under the turning with worms

If it is breaking down 
to wear down the tread on my winter boots
days extending heart into your compost

that decades of dental decay canâ€™t fix
recycling heart into your sound compost
If it is not warm however your heart


that decades of decay
If it is not warm however seamlessly
even warning comes through my suggestion
until a seamless sky passed through phasing

re-recycled hearts into your compost
one more day extending head to compost




recycled hearts into your food compost




not to drill a seamless sky through greeting
more day extending hear to your compost
days recycling heart into your compost
recycling heart to your phrasing compost

compost heart to your phasing
not until an ingrown sky through greeting
until a seamless sky passed through heating

until a godless sky passed through phasing
the heat of bile warms 
even warming under the top soil

more days extending hear to your compost



If it is not dark in the compost 

and turn under the broken earth with worms
compost heat days sing to your recycling
until not an ingrown sky through greeting

even under the turning heap with worms

recycling heart into your warm compost
like worms churning around under the heap
not until a seamless sky through greeting
the heat of vile worms  



compost days heat into your recycling
more day extending heat to your compost
of the composted heart 

If it is a worm day and after noon

early warning comes fro my suggestion
compost heart to your days recycling
compost days sing heat to your recycling
more days recycling heat to your compost
phasing recycled hearts into compost

recycling heart to your flowing compost
that you hear under the top soil
more days of recycled heat to your compost

even warning comes from my suggestions
not to will a seamless sky through greeting


when I suggested you would die alone

compost heart to your phasing recycling
not to ill a seamless sky through greeting
even warming




days recycling heart into your compost 
phasing recycled art into compost
unless 

under the broken earth turning with worms
like words turning ground under the heap
If it is not warned however phrasing
recycled suits into your good compost
If it is warning


to bear down further decaying in mind
If it is not heart in the compost however

days heart compost into your recycling
to bear down further down the winter soil

of 

phasing recycled heat to your compost

of rounded greetings 

until a dreamless sky passed through phasing
like works turning from within the heap
not filling a cloudless greeting sky one
until an unclean sky passed through phasing
