all the dust of a voided sensory
lining weightless to disintegrating up

in from where I am form my ligaments
freezing border of supportive statements

and withdraw and wait in the unlit
expressions of unlit quiet

When I have nothing to do with feeling
for a voided planetary feeling

expressions of a voided sensory
recoverable feeling

When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
where I am not formable to care

from still warm shared distant referencing
also bowing back to a waiting form
