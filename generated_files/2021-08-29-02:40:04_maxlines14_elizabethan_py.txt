freezing conditions at the elastic
where I am not able to care form
When I distinguish the material
weight-bearing sensory impression

as it falls back
immaterial
in time as an orthogonal feeling
of a simple hand wish to feel

from time in the inward collapse
drifting and signaling a distinctly
body of disintegrating feelings
When I have nothing to do with the

to time as an orthogonal moment
unmet in the step toward another
