My friendâ€™s grandma
Must be maintained
Just say no to drugs
If I have nothing to say

There in the median
Over the wire

And offer to buy a hot meal
And old working people
To raise attraction
On a distant inhaling

with elastic freezing




Under the ocean



For an iridescent leap
climb out of the strip
I call this suburban space
Everything vibrates and hums
It is best to avoid cars
A separation
