If it is a warm day and after noon
for not filling a cloudless greeting one
For subdevelopments
and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
when I suggested you would be alone

The landscape of a market
until an unseen sky passed through phasing




Until you my dear
when I suggested you would end ingrown


Over the wire

until not an ingrown sky through greeting
to bear down further into memory
Community service


recycled suits into your good compost




But the land could be

until a godless sky passed through phasing


And the tire shop in town

recycling heart into your warm compost




There in the median
On a distant inhaling



archived


like terms turning to sound under the heap

A separation
Saying thank you




If not warm from churning through 
From the market of ideas


Find out of the forest
recycling heart to your flowing compost
re-recycled hearts into your compost
For an iridescent heap
It can be a long time
that decades of dental decay can’t fix
until an ingrown sky passed through greeting


like worms from under the turning heap
even warmer
With elastic freezing
inhaling leap

Units of light quiet
If it is not warm however cloudless
If it is not warm however phrasing
even warming under the top soil

Under the ocean
The landscape around the restaurant
If I tell you to distinct 



like worms turning around under the heap
Between Dundee 
Closing at 5
Must be maintained

If it is not warned however phrasing
I blame this on suburban space
until a seamless sky passed through greeting




until a seamless sky passed through phasing
not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
And old working people

If I have nothing to say
like words turning ground under the heap
like works turning from within the heap
even warning gives my suggestion days

Until too many deer
DRINK
Vibrates and hums
more day extending heat to your compost
For the peaceful hum of it


like turns turning the sound inside a heap

of iridescent words left too long out
even warming
If it is breaking down 


to bear down further decaying in mind
Elastic unit


There in the median 
And offering the land
And offer a hot meal
When there are no patrons




Just say no to drugs

more days extending heat to your compost



I call this suburban space

that decades of decay
And say thank you
Standing on the median
of iridescent words left for too long
And offer to buy a hot meal
But open 364 otherwise
And take them gladly
even warming the compound



compost heart to your days recycling
If not warm from turning the broken earth
until not a seamless sky through greeting

like terms turning the sound inside a heap
phasing recycled art into compost
Of separation
compost days bring heat to your recycling
Joining invertebrates
more day extending heat to your compost.
the heat of vile worms  
If it is not warm however and not

to wear down further into memory
If it is not heart in the compost however
Nothing vibrates and hums

A distant inhaling


And Saunders
past when her husband is buried

And Walters

into the country
of forest
If it is a worm day and after noon




And offering the landscape



Until I come out
not to drill a seamless sky through greeting
If you unwind
71

of iridescent and prepackaged words
seamlessly archived
median of separation




median

It is best to avoid




more day extending hear to your compost
phasing recycled heat to your compost
Of body weight
not to will a seamless sky through greeting




a food market
And a soda

more days recycling heart to your compost
that you wear under the top soil


My friend’s grandma
when I suggested you would die alone
Feeding subdevelopments



of the market
Is an old building

not to ill a seamless sky through greeting
If it is not warm however phasing
Of the front door 
is sorting stickers for
and turn under the broken earth with worms
like words turning from under the heap



of grounded greetings

If it is not warm and not seamlessly
already grown recently

If it is warning

like words turning under from the heap
And be kind
For an iridescent leap
when I suggested you would end alone
And when the hum is loudest



of iridescent newly packaged words
phasing recycled hear into compost
With innumerable crabs
edge of feeling unlit
even warning comes through my suggestion
under the turning with worms
climb out of the strip
That is the strip of forest
not until a seamless sky through greeting
even warning comes from my suggestions

recycled parts into your good compost
before that
With the market of ideas




to bear down further in decaying mind



like worms churning around under the heap
And proffering the land

phasing recycled parts into compost
of my mouth
I can still buy a drink
to bear down further into memory 
If not warm and the volume of vile worms
recycling heart into your sound compost
phase compost heart 

Turning out of the lot
recycling
not to fill a godless sky greeting one
like terms churning around inside a heap
In the parking lot
Under the body weight
compost days sing heat to your recycling
that not to fill a cloudless greeting one
recycling heat into your part compost



If it is not warm however seamlessly
It is best to avoid cars

Of a market of ideas
days recycling heart into your compost
unless 
Body weight
With too many deers
compost heart to your phasing

To raise attraction


With a taxon of the market
early warning comes fro my suggestion
set of condominiums
Offering a land
for the growing



days extending heart into your compost
recycled hearts into your food compost
For past warming
compost days heat into your recycling
from the market of airconditioned ideas
under the broken earth turning with worms
when I suggested you would be two-tone
one more day extending head to compost



days recycling heart into your compost 




If it is not warm however your heart


If not warm from turning through what was lost

The kids know hours




iridescent leap
But the land could be 
not to fill a seamless sky greeting one

recycling heart to your phrasing compost
Between Dundee



more days extending hear to your compost


and to find quiet

compost heat days sing to your recycling

the heat of bile warms 
I’d not seen him much
If it is not warm however and say
With innumerable invertebrates


that you hear under the top soil
If I mistake memory
Already grown




iridescent median


With a taxonomy of the market

until a seamless sky passed through singing
Past warming
to bear sound further into memory
If it is not dark in the compost 


Over the invertebrate wire
phasing recycled air into compost
compost heart to your phasing recycling
phasing recycled hearts into compost




DEER

lives in one




more days of recycled heat to your compost

part phrasing 
until a dreamless sky passed through phasing

re-recycled parts into your compost
recently set of condominiums
Unit of body weight


If what I tell you
even warming comes from out digestion

like terms churning around under a heap



Where there are no patrons
until an unseen fly passed through phasing

And a hot meal

Everything vibrates and hums
The landscape



to bear down further down the winter soil
On a distant iridescent



like terms churning the sound inside a heap
until a seamless sky passed through heating
The kids know such hours
of 
more days recycling heat to your compost

even warning comes through to suggestion
until an unclean sky passed through phasing
of rounded greetings 


not until an ingrown sky through greeting

days heart compost into your recycling




even under the turning heap with worms

of the composted heart 
the heat of vile worms
Everything vibrates there in the median
to wear down the tread on my winter boots

of iridescent and repackaged words
not filling a cloudless greeting sky one
and shut out the light and mocked the moon




the days heart compost to your recycling


like words turning under the grounded heap

If it is not warm however vile heat
