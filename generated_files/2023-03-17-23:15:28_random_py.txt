of 
to bear down further into memory

Saying thank you


until a seamless sky passed through greeting
If it is not warned however phrasing
If not warm from turning the broken earth
From the market of ideas
DRINK

Of separation
I call this suburban space

Over the wire

But the land could be



until a godless sky passed through phasing
A separation



not to fill a godless sky greeting one

For an iridescent heap
It is best to avoid
like turns turning the sound inside a heap



If it is a warm day and after noon

until a seamless sky passed through phasing
For an iridescent leap

that decades of dental decay can’t fix
even warning gives my suggestion days


and shut the light out and mocked the late moon


iridescent median
phase compost heart 
not until a seamless sky through greeting




And Walters
Of the front door 
to wear down further into memory
phasing recycled parts into compost
but the land could be 
compost days sing heat to your recycling

If not warm from turning through what was lost
when I suggested you would end ingrown
Elastic unit
when I suggested you would end alone
Until you my dear
of iridescent words left too long out
Between Dundee 
Units of light quiet
even warming the compound




With too many deers




Unit of body weight

climb out of the strip



under the turning with worms
If I have nothing to say
And offer to buy a hot meal
There in the median 
If it is not warm however phrasing
archived



There in the median

more day extending heat to your compost


I can still buy a drink
If I tell you to distinct 




days recycling heart into your compost
Under the ocean

of forest
It is best to avoid cars
Joining invertebrates
compost days bring heat to your recycling
like words turning under from the heap
days extending heart into your compost
If it is not warm however seamlessly
not to drill a seamless sky through greeting

more days extending heat to your compost



Is an old building
Must be maintained
And say thank you

And offering the landscape
For subdevelopments


And old working people
Nothing vibrates and hums

Just say no to drugs
seamlessly archived
of grounded greetings
not to ill a seamless sky through greeting



inhaling leap
A distant inhaling
With elastic freezing

compost heat days sing to your recycling


recycling heart into your warm compost

The landscape of a market
On a distant inhaling


phasing recycled hearts into compost
like terms turning to sound under the heap



even warming comes from out digestion

set of condominiums


And offer a hot meal
Closing at 5
like terms churning around inside a heap
And a hot meal
like words turning from under the heap

If it is warning
even warning comes from my suggestions


That is the strip of forest

not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one
And a soda
for not filling a cloudless greeting one
of iridescent and repackaged words


And take them gladly
For the peaceful hum of it
If it is not warm however cloudless


before that
And Saunders

With the market of ideas
to bear sound further into memory
when I suggested you would be alone




And when the hum is loudestlike words turning ground under the heap
Of body weight


Find out of the forest



And the tire shop in town

Everything vibrates there in the median
If it is not warm however your heart
If not warm from churning through 

It can be a long time
until a dreamless sky passed through phasing
If it is not warm however and say
Standing on the median



recycled hearts into your food compost

And be kind
the heat of vile worms
a food market


I blame this on suburban space




Body weight
Until too many deer

Until I come out

If it is a worm day and after noon
The kids know hours



of the market



to bear down further into memory 
Vibrates and hums

until an unseen sky passed through phasing
that you hear under the top soil
the heat of vile worms  
that decades of decay
not until an ingrown sky through greeting
already grown recently

And proffering the land
part phrasing 
like works turning from within the heap
For past warming
My friend’s grandma
like worms from under the turning heap
under the broken earth turning with worms

re-recycled hearts into your compost
even warming
recycling heart to your flowing compost
To raise attraction
like worms churning around under the heap

recycling heart to your phrasing compost
for the growing
phasing recycled hear into compost

median
more days of recycled heat to your compost
even warning comes through my suggestion
Community service
more day extending hear to your compost

If you unwind

is sorting stickers for

Offering a land
If it is breaking down 
days heart compost into your recycling
compost heart to your phasing


until an ingrown sky passed through greeting


iridescent leap


until an unseen fly passed through phasing

when I suggested you would be two-tone
of iridescent words left for too long

more days extending hear to your compost
