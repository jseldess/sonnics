state holding recoverable feeling
to light up an orthogonal over
the hard insulated underside
When I grow  like compound spaces

for a simple time and a simple hand
When I reinforce the material
in an array
of freezing conditional

When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
form the head to the little hand holding
to bring me back to an original
unmet in the step toward requiring

If I step from one void to another
from rhyme
