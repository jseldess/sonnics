and withdraw and wait in the unlit
and expect the expressions that arise
and quiet
at the erratic border
at the erratic
at the elastic border
and vacuous immaterial
and vacuous conditional
and vacuous expressions
and silent
as an orthogonal overrunning
as an orthogonal over
as an orthogonal feeling
also bowing back to the waiting form
also bowing back to the waiting from
and find a sensory to reinforce
and expect the expressions that ariese
as time is an orthogonal concern
as time in an orthogonal concern
and reinforce the conditional dust
after feelings are disintegrated
absent of feeling and
absent of irredeemable feeling
absent of feeling
absent of considerable feeling
absent of feeling irredeemably
and find a requirement to reinforce
and
all the dust of a voided sesnory
acquiring a momentary feeling
absent emotions
and require the conditional support
and fill with all the conditional dust
and fill it with all the conditional
and fill it with all the dust avoided
absent
absent the data loading constantly
and I distinguish around reinforced
all the dust of a voided sensory
absent in the light of the long day
and expect the conditions that arise
and expect the conditions that I pose
and withdraw and wait in the unmet
absent extensions out of the long day
absent expression out of the long day
and expect the
absent emotion out of the long form
and find a sensory
absent emotion reinforced under
absent emotion from conditional
and find a sensory impression
absent emotion
another default lesion
absent emotion from material
absent emotion out of the formal
absent expression out of the
at the back of the plastic drawer with paint
animals that need consistent feeding
are strained by the floating dust
all the dust
and expressions
all the dust in tv material
also form bowing back to where I am
a still warm
a still shared warm
a still warm shared transitioned reference
also form bowing back to the waiting
also form bowing back to its waiting
also from bowing back to the waiting
a shared and transitioned reference
also from a shared and transitioned frame
also from a shared and transferred frame
also form bowing back from where I am
also from bowing back from where I am
all the dust of the voided sensory
also bowing back to a waiting form
a simple hand holding a simple form
a simple time holding a simple hand
as it falls back
also bowing back to my waiting face
as it keeps form
and immaterial
and wandering for the chance and distinct
and tearing the collapse of ligaments
