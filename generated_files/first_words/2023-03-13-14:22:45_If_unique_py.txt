If I am sitting in a room
If I am sitting in a room where I land
If I step from one void to another
If what I tell you can be undying
If I step
If I reinforce the material
If I distinguish the conditional
If I reinforce the conditional
If I step from one void to anot
If I withdraw and wait in the unlit
If I ask are there ways to distinguish
If what I tell you can be unwinding
If I look out the window
If I want to
If I draw and wait
If I first feel
If I first
If I reinforce material
If I step from one void
If I dissolve and insulate feelings
If I dissolve and insulate
If I ask
If it is a warm day and after noon
If not warm from turning the broken earth
If not warm and the volume of vile worms
If not warm from turning through what was lost
If not warm from churning through 
If it is not warm however cloudless
If it is breaking down 
If it is a worm day and after noon
If it is not heart in the compost however
If it is not dark in the compost 
If it is not warm however vile heat
If it is not warm however your heart
If it is not warm however phrasing
If it is not warned however phrasing
If it is not warm however phasing
If it is not warm however and say
If it is not warm however seamlessly
If it is not warm however and not
If it is warning
If it is not warm and not seamlessly
If it is a warm day and after noon
