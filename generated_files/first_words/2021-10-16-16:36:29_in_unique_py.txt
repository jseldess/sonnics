in an array
inhaling border
in a silent membrane
inhalations
in a freezing vacuum
in time
in time as an orthogonal feeling
in time as an orthogonal concern
in the inward collapse to time
in the apartment in which we are reading
in back of the plastic drawer with paint
in back of the broken plastic drawer
in the dust
in the inward collapse
in the dust of a voided sensory
in immaterial expressions
into time to disintegrate up
in from to the waiting formal body
in from
in form to the waiting formal body
in from to the waiting boy to care for
in from where I am form my ligaments
in from where I am from
inherit full of dust reinforced time
inherit with a time voided sensor
in its ligaments
