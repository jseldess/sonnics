When I compress to disintegrate up
When I distinguish the material
When I distinguish around reinforced
When I absent or like imploding men
When I compound and express early cause
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
When I have nothing to do with feeling
When I reinforce the material
When I have nothing with weight-bearing force
When I have nothing to do with feelings
When I have nothing to do with the
When I withdraw into the weight-bearing
When I have nothing to do with unlit
When I have nothing to do with all the
When I have nothing do with the time
When I compound and express an early
When I reinforce the waiting formal
When I extend to disintegrate up
When I step back into the compression
When I let the compression
When I spot the compression
When I flatten under the compression
When I compress time to integrate up
When I break time to disintegrate up
When I distinguish the materials
When I grow time to disintegrate up
When I grow  like compound spaces
When I distinguish all the dust around
When I distinguish around the voided
When I distinguish that materials
When I extinguish that materials
When I absent or like collapsing men
When I absent like the collapsing men
When I assent or like collapsing men
