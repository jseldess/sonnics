to bear down further decaying in mind
seamlessly archived


recycled suits into your good compost

If it is a warm day and after noon


even warning gives my suggestion days




and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
If it is not warm however cloudless
when I suggested you would end ingrown
until a godless sky passed through phasing



If it is not dark in the compost 



If it is not warm however and say




that decades of dental decay canâ€™t fix

to wear down the tread on my winter boots
to bear down further into memory
