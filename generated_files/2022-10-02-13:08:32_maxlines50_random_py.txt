between one void and another

I ask if there are ways to distinguish
the requirements of conditional dust
the conditional dust

reinforce the feeling




When I absent or like imploding men


hard immaterial expressions

with a voided sensor
body deflecting
also form bowing back to the waiting
If I first
one void declaring after another
form that cannot accommodate feeling
conditional expression of support
dissolving and insulating feelings

body-alive matter
and another
bowing back to the waiting form from
shuffling to a redeemable place


also bowing back to the waiting form
bowing back that inform from my waiting
by traveling all the way down

where it frames and reaches up and out
of conditional and freezing

unlit walls of a voided sensory
and concrete feelings would arise
between one slow long
avoided in the immaterial
required
one void disintegrating another
from where I am not formable to care
the voided sensor of materials
with displacing heat

from rhyme as an orthogonal over
reinforced unmet
recoverable feeling

inhaling border

in form to the waiting formal body
not a simple time
long days out of the absent expression
inhaling

formal body dissolving underside

form as it keeps the face hardly caring


voided state to return to

repairing one void after another


I voided a sensor inheritance
is not in form


I didnâ€™t want to take a job
absent extensions out of the long day
also bowing back to a waiting form
