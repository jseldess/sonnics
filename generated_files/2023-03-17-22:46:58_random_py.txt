not to fill a godless sky greeting one

Until you my dear
With a taxonomy of the market
until not an ingrown sky through greeting
of iridescent newly packaged words
archived
Over the wire




There in the median




If I have nothing to say


to bear down further down the winter soil

Of separation

On a distant inhaling
If it is a warm day and after noon




re-recycled hearts into your compost
If it is not warm however cloudless
and to find quiet
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
more days recycling heart to your compost
Saying thank you

and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
more days extending heat to your compost
phasing recycled hearts into compost

For past warming
when I suggested you would end ingrown
unless 




Closing at 5
Nothing vibrates and hums


even warming the compound
that not to fill a cloudless greeting one
And old working people
I call this suburban space

and shut out the light and mocked the moon


My friend’s grandma

And the tire shop in town

until an ingrown sky passed through greeting
DRINK

that decades of decay
Offering a land
And offer a hot meal

under the turning with worms
early warning comes fro my suggestion



like worms churning around under the heap



When there are no patrons
In the parking lot
It can be a long time




Find out of the forest
even warning gives my suggestion days

until not a seamless sky through greeting
past when her husband is buried
more day extending heat to your compost.
Turning out of the lot

of iridescent words left too long out
And a soda
like worms turning around under the heap




And proffering the land
days heart compost into your recycling
when I suggested you would be alone
to bear down further into memory
not to will a seamless sky through greeting


phasing recycled art into compost



recycling
set of condominiums

For subdevelopments



Is an old building
for the growing
It is best to avoid
like words turning under from the heap
part phrasing 



like words turning from under the heap


Units of light quiet


The landscape of a market
recycled parts into your good compost
Of a market of ideas

I blame this on suburban space

like terms churning around under a heap
median of separation
Unit of body weight
For an iridescent leap
But the land could be
more day extending heat to your compost


for not filling a cloudless greeting one
with elastic freezing
that decades of dental decay can’t fix
the heat of vile worms
I can still buy a drink
phasing recycled heat to your compost

to wear down further into memory
A separation




of 

is sorting stickers for
Of body weight
If not warm from churning through 


until a seamless sky passed through singing
Community service
Everything vibrates there in the median

Must be maintained

but the land could be 
And offering the landscape
recycling heart to your flowing compost

even warning comes through to suggestion
If it is not warm however and say


Under the ocean


And offer to buy a hot meal

the heat of bile warms 




until an unclean sky passed through phasing
phase compost heart 
And say thank you
And when the hum is loudest
phasing recycled hear into compost
compost heart to your days recycling

not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one
to wear down the tread on my winter boots
of the composted heart 

not to fill a seamless sky greeting one

to bear down further in decaying mind
like words turning under the grounded heap



when I suggested you would end alone
Just say no to drugs
With a taxon of the market



For an iridescent heap
If it is warning




From the market of ideas
For the peaceful hum of it



Until too many deer
of iridescent and prepackaged words




until a seamless sky passed through phasing

And be kind
edge of feeling unlit
a food market

If it is breaking down 
compost days sing heat to your recycling
climb out of the strip
not until an ingrown sky through greeting

until a seamless sky passed through greeting
The landscape around the restaurant
Under the body weight



like worms from under the turning heap
I’d not seen him much
seamlessly archived

even warning comes through my suggestion

If I tell you to distinct 
under the broken earth turning with worms

With innumerable invertebrates
not to drill a seamless sky through greeting
lives in one



recycling heart into your sound compost
even under the turning heap with worms
until an unseen sky passed through phasing
recently set of condominiums
more days of recycled heat to your compost




of grounded greetings
If it is not warm however and not
And Walters
more days recycling heat to your compost
until a dreamless sky passed through phasing
If it is not warm however phrasing
If it is not warm however seamlessly



If it is not warm and not seamlessly

already grown recently
71
Everything vibrates and hums
Of the front door 
If it is not warm however your heart

of forest

Between Dundee
Elastic unit
compost heart to your phasing recycling
To raise attraction
like terms churning around inside a heap
phasing recycled air into compost
If it is not warned however phrasing
Between Dundee 
With the market of ideas
and turn under the broken earth with worms
If it is a worm day and after noon
when I suggested you would die alone
