on the wall of the void
to lift up an orthogonal ground
in from where I am from
form bowing back to the waiting formal
and withdraw and wait in the unlit
to lift up an orthogonal over
but could not escape the freezing vacuum
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing

conditions of a voided sensory
When I reinforce the material
also form bowing back to the waiting
spaces between one void and another
for a simple time and a simple hand
running translucent immaterial
