If it is not dark in the compost 
more days recycling heart to your compost
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
more day extending heat to your compost.
until an unseen sky passed through phasing
the heat of vile worms
to bear down further into memory
when I suggested you would end ingrown
even warming under the top soil
If it is a warm day and after noon
even warning comes through to suggestion
recycled hearts into your food compost
of
