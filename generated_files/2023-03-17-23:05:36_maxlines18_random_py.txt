If it is a warm day and after noon
Saying thank you
until a seamless sky passed through singing
There in the median
even warning gives my suggestion days



With a taxon of the market
more day extending heat to your compost
If it is not warm however cloudless
like terms churning around inside a heap
Between Dundee
If not warm from turning the broken earth

until not an ingrown sky through greeting


not to drill a seamless sky through greeting



I blame this on suburban space

like turns turning the sound inside a heap




For an iridescent leap



If you unwind
to bear down further into memory
