under the broken earth turning with worms

more days extending heat to your compost
I blame this on suburban space



of forest



For an iridescent leap
Elastic unit
for not filling a cloudless greeting one
already grown recently

But the land could be

when I suggested you would end ingrown
archived
With elastic freezing
When there are no patrons

lives in one




If I have nothing to say



when I suggested you would be alone
If it is a warm day and after noon

If it is not warm however phrasing
of grounded greetings
Saying thank you

On a distant inhaling
edge of feeling unlit




like words turning under from the heap




and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
seamlessly archived


Must be maintained

to bear down further into memory
Until you my dear
not to fill a godless sky greeting one
but the land could be 

With the market of ideas

recycling

until an unseen sky passed through phasing
more day extending heat to your compost
Under the ocean
even warning gives my suggestion days
It can be a long time
With innumerable invertebrates



Nothing vibrates and hums
It is best to avoid
Feeding subdevelopments




and old working people



There in the median
Until I come out
If it is not warned however phrasing

And proffering the land
compost heart to your days recycling




If it is breaking down 
for the growing
even warmer

compost days bring heat to your recycling
Over the wire



to wear down the tread on my winter boots

And when the hum is loudest



The landscape of a market
I call this suburban space
If not warm from turning through what was lost
under the turning with worms
But open 364 otherwise
until a godless sky passed through phasing

of iridescent words left too long out


For past warming

And be kind
Is an old building

not until a seamless sky through greeting
to bear down further decaying in mind


iridescent median

If I mistake memory
compost days heat into your recycling
If what I tell you
If it is not warm however cloudless
If it is not warm however and say
And offer to buy a hot meal
to wear down further into memory
Of the front door 

Over the invertebrate wire
Past warming

If it is not warm however seamlessly
There in the median 
more day extending hear to your compost

Joining invertebrates

If it is not warm however vile heat




And offer a hot meal
If not warm and the volume of vile worms
phasing recycled art into compost


even warning comes through my suggestion
Closing at 5
until a seamless sky passed through heating
And offering the landscape
With too many deers
With a taxonomy of the market
recycled hearts into your food compost
the heat of vile worms
From the market of ideas
If it is not dark in the compost 
more days recycling heart to your compost



re-recycled hearts into your compost
A separation

like worms churning around under the heap
of 

find out of the forest
when I suggested you would end alone
and turn under the broken earth with worms
And say thank you




If it is not warm however phasing

Vibrates and hums
re-recycled parts into your compost
Under the body weight
days recycling heart into your compost
recycled parts into your good compost

is sorting stickers for
like words turning under the grounded heap


If not warm from turning the broken earth



In the parking lot

Of separation

I can still buy a drink




phasing recycled air into compost

Units of light quiet
compost days sing heat to your recycling
recycling heart into your warm compost
The landscape around the restaurant
iridescent leap


and to find quiet
like terms churning around inside a heap

If it is not warm and not seamlessly
recycling heart to your flowing compost
into the country
And the tire shop in town
My friendâ€™s grandma

even under the turning heap with worms
even warming
before that



until a seamless sky passed through phasing
And take them gladly
to bear down further into memory 

not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one

Between Dundee

Until too many deer
set of condominiums
of the composted heart 


Community service
even warming comes from out digestion
like terms turning to sound under the heap
If it is not heart in the compost however
until an ingrown sky passed through greeting

to bear down further in decaying mind

the days heart compost to your recycling
like words turning from under the heap
when I suggested you would be two-tone

more days recycling heat to your compost
climb out of the strip
If it is not warm however and not
recycled suits into your good compost

to bear sound further into memory
until a seamless sky passed through greeting
Everything vibrates and hums
For an iridescent heap
For subdevelopments
like works turning from within the heap
If not warm from churning through 
like words turning ground under the heap
A distant inhaling
like worms from under the turning heap


until an unclean sky passed through phasing
not filling a cloudless greeting sky one
days extending heart into your compost
until a seamless sky passed through singing
Turning out of the lot

Unit of body weight
of my mouth
recycling heart into your sound compost
It is best to avoid cars
not to ill a seamless sky through greeting
past when her husband is buried
not until an ingrown sky through greeting




unless 
And when the hum is loudest
