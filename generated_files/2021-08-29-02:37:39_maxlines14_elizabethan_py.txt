membrane of feeling
faces for disintegrating feeling
form bowing back to the waiting formal
in the inward collapse

also form bowing back to the waiting
for a simple time and a simple hand
that makes it hard to
as it keeps form

where my face can get some sun
from one unlit point to another
body of disintegrating feelings
expressions of conditional support

and withdraw and wait in the unlit
and find a sensory to reinforce
