until a godless sky passed through phasing
even warning gives my suggestion days
more day extending heat to your compost




and turn under the broken earth with worms
If it is not warm however cloudless
more days extending heat to your compost
when I suggested you would end ingrown
If it is not heart in the compost however

like words turning under from the heap




for not filling a cloudless greeting one
compost heart to your phasing

not to ill a seamless sky through greeting



until a seamless sky passed through heating

like words turning under the grounded heap
