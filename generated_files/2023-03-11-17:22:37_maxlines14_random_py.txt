when I suggested you would be alone




Nay, if you read this line, remember not

and shut the light out and mocked the late moon


more days recycling heart to your compost
archived
compost heart to your phasing recycling
days extending heart into your compost

If it is not warm however vile heat
of the composted heart 
If it is a warm day and after noon
phasing recycled parts into compost

like worms churning around under the heap

more days extending heat to your compost
under the turning with worms
