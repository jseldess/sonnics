And a hot meal



It can be a long time
For past warming
DEER



With the market of ideas

I blame this on suburban space
The landscape of a market
There in the median
Closing at 5
If I have nothing to say
Over the wire
elastic unit

Saying thank you
The landscape around the restaurant
Until you my dear



Between Dundee 
Just say no to drugs

DRINK

I’d not seen him much
For an iridescent leap
I can still buy a drink



When there are no patrons
That is the strip of forest
Find out of the forest
And offer a hot meal

of forest
Under the ocean
And proffering the land
And old working people




Nothing vibrates and hums


Must be maintained

A separation

median of separation




Vibrates and hums


Of separation
There in the median 

For subdevelopments
Units of light quiet

set of condominiums

but the land could be 
Everything vibrates and hums
But the land could be
into the country

And the tire shop in town


already grown recently
iridescent leap

lives in one

a food market
And when the hum is loudest

And say thank you



Past warming
Of the front door 


Turning out of the lot


for the growing



The kids know such hours
To raise attraction




For an iridescent heap
With elastic freezing



My friend’s grandma
On a distant inhaling
Until I come out

Over the invertebrate wire


The landscape
Of body weight


If I tell you to distinct 
from the market of airconditioned ideas




median
I call this suburban space

past when her husband is buried

Under the body weight
Joining invertebrates
It is best to avoid
From the market of ideas
And a soda
Between Dundee

And offer to buy a hot meal
iridescent median



Unit of body weight

inhaling leap
With a taxon of the market




And Walters
A distant inhaling
And offering the land


and to find quiet

climb out of the strip
is an old building
And be kind
Until too many deer
Of a market of ideas

And take them gladly
recently set of condominiums




before that

If I mistake memory

Offering a land

And when the hum is loudestStanding on the median
With a taxonomy of the market

With innumerable invertebrates




If what I tell you
is sorting stickers for




Where there are no patrons
Feeding subdevelopments
And offering the landscape
If you unwind
The kids know hours
Already grown
Body weight
With innumerable crabs

In the parking lot


Community service
With too many deers
But open 364 otherwise



For the peaceful hum of it
Everything vibrates there in the median


of the market

edge of feeling unlit
It is best to avoid cars
And Saunders

On a distant iridescent
