also form bowing back to where I am
where I am not able to care form
absent emotion reinforced under
expressions of a voided sensory
conditions of a voided sensory
form bowing back to the waiting formal
as it keeps form
and withdraw and wait in the unlit

running translucent immaterial membrane
shuffling to a weight-bearing distinct
break from still warm distant referencing
transition from one void to another
When I compound and express early cause
still warm
