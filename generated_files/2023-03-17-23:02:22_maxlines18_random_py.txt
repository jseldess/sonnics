The landscape of a market
iridescent leap
until a seamless sky passed through greeting
If it is not warm and not seamlessly
to bear down further into memory
a food market




and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
like words turning under the grounded heap
set of condominiums
not to fill a godless sky greeting one


until an unseen sky passed through phasing
like words turning under from the heap




If it is a warm day and after noon
Already grown
If I have nothing to say
A separation
recycling heart to your flowing compost



Just say no to drugs
