immaterial
When I absent like the collapsing men
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
where the head will not form

break into time to disintegrate up
formal body dispelling reference
also from bowing back to the waiting
freezing border of supportive feeling

I see in tv
When I have nothing to do with feeling
shuffling to a redeemable place
signaling and touching a distinctly

from where I am not formable in from
spaces between one void and another
