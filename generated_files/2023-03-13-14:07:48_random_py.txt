not filling a cloudless greeting sky one
to bear down further into memory

If it is not dark in the compost 
when I suggested you would end ingrown
until an unseen sky passed through phasing
phasing recycled hear into compost

seamlessly archived
and shut the light out and mocked the late moon
If not warm and the volume of vile worms
of iridescent words left too long out
archived
If it is not warm however seamlessly

like terms churning around inside a heap



when I suggested you would end alone
and shut out the light and mocked the moon
under the turning with worms

more days extending heat to your compost

to wear down further into memory


If it is a warm day and after noon



If not warm from churning through 

like worms from under the turning heap
If it is a warm day and after noon

like words turning under from the heap
more day extending heat to your compost

even warning gives my suggestion days



If it is not warm however and not

until a dreamless sky passed through phasing
one more day extending head to compost

the heat of vile worms  


until a seamless sky passed through singing
not to fill a godless sky greeting one



If it is not heart in the compost however

re-recycled hearts into your compost
like turns turning the sound inside a heap
even warming the compound
of iridescent words left for too long
If it is not warm however your heart
of 
that decades of decay

like terms churning the sound inside a heap
when I suggested you would be alone

even under the turning heap with worms

phasing recycled parts into compost
recycled parts into your good compost

If it is not warm however and say
If it is a worm day and after noon



phasing recycled air into compost
for not filling a cloudless greeting one
until a seamless sky passed through greeting

not until an ingrown sky through greeting
like words turning under the grounded heap
recycling heart to your phrasing compost
to bear down further in decaying mind
more days recycling heart to your compost
If it is not warm however cloudless




not to will a seamless sky through greeting
like words turning from under the heap
not to fill a cloudless sky greeting one



like words turning ground under the heap
to wear down the tread on my winter boots
phasing recycled hearts into compost
compost heart to your days recycling
re-recycled parts into your compost



like worms turning around under the heap
If not warm from turning the broken earth




like worms churning around under the heap
like terms turning to sound under the heap
even warming



until an ingrown sky passed through greeting
to bear sound further into memory
like terms churning around under a heap



If not warm from turning through what was lost
not until a seamless sky through greeting

compost heart to your phasing recycling
that you hear under the top soil
not to drill a seamless sky through greeting
even warmer
to bear down further down the winter soil
compost days heat into your recycling
even warning comes through to suggestion
phase compost heart 
recycling heart into your warm compost
If it is not warm however phasing
until an unclean sky passed through phasing
and turn under the broken earth with worms
of rounded greetings 
more days recycling heat to your compost
until a seamless sky passed through heating
until a seamless sky passed through phasing
if it is a warm day and after noon
until a godless sky passed through phasing
like works turning from within the heap
of grounded greetings
compost days sing heat to your recycling
of my mouth
compost days bring heat to your recycling
If it is breaking down 




even warning comes through my suggestion
not to fill a seamless sky greeting one
If it is not warned however phrasing



more days extending hear to your compost

that you wear under the top soil
to bear down further decaying in mind



the heat of vile worms
If it is not warm and not seamlessly
of iridescent newly packaged words
until not an ingrown sky through greeting

more days of recycled heat to your compost
early warning comes fro my suggestion
to bear down further into memory 




recycling
the heat of bile warms 
recycling heart into your sound compost
recycling heat into your part compost
of iridescent and repackaged words

that not to fill a cloudless greeting one
phasing recycled art into compost
days recycling heart into your compost 
the days heart compost to your recycling

If it is warning


If it is not warm however phrasing
recycling heart to your flowing compost
when I suggested you would be two-tone
under the broken earth turning with worms

until an unseen fly passed through phasing
until not a seamless sky through greeting

not to ill a seamless sky through greeting


of the composted heart 
when I suggested you would die alone
recycled hearts into your food compost
even warming comes from out digestion




of iridescent and prepackaged words
that decades of dental decay canâ€™t fix

unless 



If it is not warm however vile heat
recycled suits into your good compost
compost heat days sing to your recycling

even warning comes from my suggestions
part phrasing 

phasing recycled heat to your compost
days recycling heart into your compost
more day extending hear to your compost
even warming under the top soil

days heart compost into your recycling
compost heart to your phasing
days extending heart into your compost
