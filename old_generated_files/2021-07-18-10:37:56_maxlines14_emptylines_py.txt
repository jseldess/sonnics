When I reinforce the material
When I distinguish the materials
I have nothing to do with domestic
voided sensory of conditional
form bowing back to the waiting formal
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
all the dust of a voided sensory
When I absent like the collapsing men
that can transmit in the tongue
to reinforce the feeling




When I have nothing to do with feeling
form where I am from in my ligaments
from where I am not formable to care
expressions of conditional support
