When I reinforce the material
body of disintegrating feelings


When I absent or like imploding men
form simple hand holding a simple form
construction from one void to another



expressions
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
I ask if there are days to distinguish
where I am not able to care form



the weight
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
signaling and touching a distinctly
a simple time holding a simple hand
