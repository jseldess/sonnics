When I compress to disintegrate up



irredeemable moment of weight-bearing


from still warm shared distant referencing
When I distinguish the materials
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
in form to the waiting formal body
all the dust of a voided sensory
expressions of conditional support
form that can carry and accommodate
from time in the inward collapse to time
When I distinguish around reinforced
bowing back that inform from my waiting
body of disintegrating feelings
When I distinguish the material
