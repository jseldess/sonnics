When I absent or like imploding men
absent or like imploding men



a weight-bearing distinct
and
full of dust reinforced again maybe
irredeemable tracing and bonding
inherit full of dust reinforced time
When I distinguish that materials
and tears from eyes I travel through
When I extinguish that materials
from time in the inward collapse to time
and bonding
When I absent like the collapsing men
dust reinforced again maybe
