absent emotion reinforced under



body of disintegrating feelings



in the inward collapse
When I distinguish the materials
all the dust
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
expression of conditional support
also bowing back to the waiting from
also form bowing back to the waiting
with a voided sensor inheritance

When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
glancing from one point to another point
from a framed hand reaching out



hearing the mumble of ligaments
