When I reinforce the material
voided sensory of conditions
formal body I dissolve where I am




your smile


form bowing back to the waiting formal
tearing not in its ligaments


When I let the compression
When I extend to disintegrate up



When I compress time to integrate up
voided sensory of conditional
also bowing back to a waiting form
When I distinguish around reinforced




expressions of conditional support
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
