where it frames and reaches up and out
When I compound and express early cause
When I compress to disintegrate up
as it falls back
form bowing back to the waiting formal
in from
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
When I distinguish the materials
signaling and touching a distinctly
body of disintegrating feelings
all the dust of a voided sensory
expressions of conditional support
from time in the inward collapse to time
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
