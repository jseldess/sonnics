When I withdraw and wait in the unlit


expressing long days out of the absent
When I distinguish the material
feelings of a disintegrating body

from still warm shared distant referencing
all the dust of a voided sensory
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
body of disintegrating feelings
When I distinguish around reinforced
When I compress to disintegrate up
When I compound and express early cause
from time in the inward collapse to time
When I have nothing to do with feeling

form bowing back to the waiting formal
