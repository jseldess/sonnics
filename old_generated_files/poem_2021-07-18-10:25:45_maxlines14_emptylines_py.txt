irredeemable moment of weight-bearing


from time in the inward collapse to time
When I reinforce the material
all the dust of a voided sensory
form that can carry and accommodate
from one void to another expression

I dissolve and insulate feelings from

signaling and touching a distinctly
expressions of conditional support
reinforced into the material
form bowing back to the waiting formal
from still warm shared distant referencing
irredeemable moment of healing
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
