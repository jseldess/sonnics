When I reinforce the material
When I distinguish around the voided
all the dust of a voided sensory
all the dust
irredeemable tracing and bonding
form bowing back to the waiting formal
solving where the restricted feeling
When I absent like the collapsing men


When I flatten under the compression
where I am not formable to care
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
worn at the joints bowing
When I distinguish the material
in the dust of a voided sensory
