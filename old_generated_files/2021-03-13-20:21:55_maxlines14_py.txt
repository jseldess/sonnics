absent like the collapsing men
of dust reinforced time
When I absent or like imploding men
of weight-bearing
for the chance and distinct
dust reinforced again maybe
voided sensor inheritance
and tears from eyes I travel through
tearing the trouble of ligaments
and bonding
to time in the inward collapse
reinforced time
full of dust reinforced
the collapsing men
