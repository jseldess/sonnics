When I reinforce the material
form bowing back to the waiting formal
When I distinguish the material
I ask if there are days to distinguish

from still warm shared distant referencing
from time in the inward collapse to time
form muscle that can block the tongue
form that can carry and accommodate

irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
hearing the mumble of ligaments




When I absent or like imploding men
body of disintegrating feelings
