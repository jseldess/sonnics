in from where I am form my ligaments
tearing the trouble of ligaments
also from bowing back to the waiting
to time healing and signaling
heading from where I am in from




am not formable to care

where I will not be able to care form


form as it falls back
form the head to the little hand holding
full of dust reinforced again maybe




bowing back to the waiting
distinguish around reinforced
cannot accommodate
