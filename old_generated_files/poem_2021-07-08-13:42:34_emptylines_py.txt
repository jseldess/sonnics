from time in the inward collapse to time
form bowing back to the waiting formal
also bowing back to the waiting from
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
When I distinguish around reinforced


from still warm shared distant referencing



When I absent or like imploding men
When I compound and express early cause
When I distinguish the material
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit
When I extinguish that materials
When I distinguish the materials
signaling and touching a distinctly
expressions of conditional support
