dust reinforced again maybe
extinguish that materials


voided sensor inheritance
of weight-bearing
of healing
all the dust of the voided sensory

When I extinguish that materials
adhering to our ligaments
absent like the collapsing men
to time healing and signaling
from time to time healing and signaling
mumble of ligaments
