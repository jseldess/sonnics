When I absent or like imploding men
expressions of conditional support
form bowing back to the waiting formal
all the dust of a voided sensory
from still warm shared distant referencing
When I compound and express early cause
body of disintegrating feelings
When I compress to disintegrate up

When I extinguish that materials
When I withdraw and wait in the unlit



irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
When I distinguish around reinforced
where I am not able to care form
When I distinguish the material
