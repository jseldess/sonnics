If I reinforce the conditional
expressions of a voided sensory

When I have nothing to do with feeling
form the head to the little hand holding

dancing from one point to another point
expression of conditional support


If I step from one void to another
and find a sensory to reinforce

reinforced in unmet material
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing
When I distinguish that materials
where I am not formable to care
disintegrating feelings in
I ask if there are ways to distinguish
