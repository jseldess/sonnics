When I distinguish the material
When I compress to disintegrate up




When I withdraw and wait in the unlit


signaling and touching a distinctly
body of disintegrating feelings
When I distinguish around reinforced
from time in the inward collapse to time



form bowing back to the waiting formal
expressions of conditional support
When I compound and express early cause
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing

from still warm shared distant referencing
ward the chance and distinctly
where my face gets sun but without sun
