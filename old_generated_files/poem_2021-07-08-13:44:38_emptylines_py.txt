also bowing back to the waiting from
and wandering for the chance and distinct
When I distinguish the material
signaling and touching a distinctly
irredeemable moment of weight-bearing




all the dust of a voided sensory
that invents and insulates feelings
When I distinguish the materials


in from where I am form my ligaments




all the dust of the voided sensory
expressions of conditional support



from time in the inward collapse to time
