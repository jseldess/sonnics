in the inward collapse
When I absent or like imploding men
the voided sensor of materials




and wandering for the chance and distinct
voided sensor inheritance
of weight-bearing
and wandering for the chance and distinct
extinguish that materials
for the chance and distinct
dust of the voided sensory
tearing not in its ligaments




irredeemable tracing and bonding
to time healing and signaling
When I extinguish that materials
