If I have nothing to say
It can be a long time
Until you my dear
Find out of the forest
With elastic freezing
Units of light quiet
For an iridescent leap
Past warming
Units of light quiet
There in the median
For an iridescent leap
There in the median
Units of light quiet
Over the wire
For an iridescent leap
Over the wire
There in the median 
Units of light quiet
With elastic freezing
Units of light quiet
A separation
There in the median
A separation
Over the wire
If I have nothing to say
It can be a long time
Until you my dear
Find out of the forest
For an iridescent heap
Vibrates and hums
A separation
Over the wire
Under the ocean
There in the median
If I have nothing to say
It can be a long time
Until you my dear
Find out of the forest
With elastic freezing
Units of light quiet
A separation
It is best to avoid
On a distant inhaling
iridescent leap
Over the wire
A distant inhaling
Unit of body weight

median of separation

inhaling leap

Over the wire
With elastic freezing
Units of light quiet
Nothing vibrates and hums
There in the median
I call this suburban space
Saying thank you
And proffering the land
For subdevelopments
For an iridescent leap
Over the wire
With elastic freezing
Units of light quiet
On a distant inhaling
Elastic unit
Of separation
For an iridescent leap

If what I tell you
on a distant inhaling
elastic unit

If you unwind
with elastic freezing
units of light quiet
If I tell you to distinct 
edge of feeling unlit
I call this suburban space
Saying thank you
And proffering the land

Over the wire
A separation

For past warming
Vibrates and hums

Saying thank you
And proffering the land
For subdevelopments
If I mistake memory
For an iridescent heap
If I have nothing to say
Over the wire
Joining invertebrates
Under the ocean
With a taxonomy of the market
Closing at 5
With a taxon of the market
Closing at 5
If I have nothing to say
Over the invertebrate wire
Under the ocean
With innumerable invertebrates
If I have nothing to say
Over the wire
Joining invertebrates
Under the ocean
With the market of ideas
Closing at 5
If I have nothing to say
Over the wire
Under the ocean
With innumerable crabs
DEER
If I have nothing to say
It can be a long time
Until you my dear
Find out of the forest
A separation
It is best to avoid
DRINK
Nothing vibrates and hums
There in the median
I call this suburban space
For subdevelopments
Saying thank you
And proffering the land
If I have nothing to say
It can be a long time
Until you my dear
Find out of the forest
A separation
It is best to avoid
Nothing vibrates and hums
There in the median
I call this suburban space
For subdevelopments
Saying thank you
And offering the land
And a soda
And a hot meal
For subdevelopments
And offer a hot meal
From the market of ideas
Closing at 5
If I have nothing to say
I blame this on suburban space
Nothing vibrates and hums
There in the median
But the land could be
The landscape of a market
If I have nothing to say
I can still buy a drink
And say thank you
And offer a hot meal
From the market of ideas
Closing at 5

Saying thank you

And the tire shop in town
And old working people

The landscape of a market
Feeding subdevelopments
I call this suburban space
Offering a land
To raise attraction
Turning out of the lot

The kids know hours
And take them gladly
If I have nothing to say
It can be a long time
Until too many deer
Find out of the forest
A separation
Between Dundee 
And Saunders
It is best to avoid
It is best to avoid cars
and to find quiet
If I have nothing to say
It can be a long time
Until I come out
Of the front door 
Until I come out
into the country
That is the strip of forest
With too many deers
If I have nothing to say
It can be a long time
Until too many deer
find out of the forest
Between Dundee
And Walters
climb out of the strip
of forest
of the market
And say thank you
And be kind
And offer to buy a hot meal
from the market of airconditioned ideas
And offer to buy a hot meal
from the market of ideas
And say thank you
And offer to buy a hot meal
from the market of ideas
closing at 5
But open 364 otherwise
The kids know such hours
And take them gladly
For the peaceful hum of it
And the tire shop in town
Is an old building
And old working people
But the land could be 
The landscape
Where there are no patrons
And the tire shop in town
And old working people
But the land could be
The landscape of a market
Already grown
recently set of condominiums
a food market
for the growing
already grown recently
set of condominiums
The landscape around the restaurant
Must be maintained
When there are no patrons
And when the hum is loudest
Community service
is sorting stickers for
Just say no to drugs

My friend’s grandma
lives in one
past when her husband is buried
I’d not seen him much
before that
If I have nothing to say
I blame this on suburban space
Everything vibrates and hums
there in the median
